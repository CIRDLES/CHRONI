        <p class="about_p">CHRONI is a mobile application developed by the <b>
          Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth
          Sciences</b>, CIRDLES, at the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC.
          CIRDLES is creating cyber infrastructure for geochronology in an
          interdisciplinary collaboration among our software engineers and
          geochemists from two NSF-supported initiatives, EARTHTIME and
          EarthChem. Using <b>ET Redux</b>, users can upload and retrieve their
          data and results to the GeoChron.org data repository. If you are
          interested in learning more about CIRDLES, please contact Dr. Bowring
          at <i>bowringj@cofc.edu.</i> Currently, Gabrielle Cozart, Tyler Newman,
          and Drew Bigelow, juniors at the College of Charleston have been
          working with Dr. James Bowring to develop this application. Gabrielle
          has been working on CHRONI since January 2015. If you are interested
          in contacting her for inquiries about the application, please email
          her at <a href="mailto:cozartge@g.cofc.edu">cozartge@g.cofc.edu</a>.
          We would like to thank the College of Charleston Department of
          Computer Science, for providing financial support for CIRDLES.
